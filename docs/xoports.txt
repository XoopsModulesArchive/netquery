The ports data option package works with Netquery v2.x and later.
Get the option installer package from http://www.virtech.org/tools/
and upload the data installer files (xoports.php and xoports2.php)
to your site. Then select the Install Ports Data Table option in
the Netquery administrator's main configuration panel.

Please note that installing the new data replaces both the port services
table and its related category flags table.  Unless it has been backed
up, any data previously entered in those tables will be lost.

Data for the port services table and updates is provided courtesy of
Colin Tinker, Nick Cross and other contributors at g1gsw.org.
