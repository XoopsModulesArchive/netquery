The GeoIP data option package works with Netquery v3.x and later.
Get the option installer package from http://www.virtech.org/tools/
and upload the data installer files (xogeoip.php and xogeoip2.php)
to your site. Then select the Install GeoIP Data Table option in
the Netquery administrator's main configuration panel.

Please note that installing the new data replaces both the geoip ranges
table and its related country codes table.  Unless it has been backed
up, any data previously entered in those tables will be lost.

Data for the GeoIP table and updates are adapted and optimised from
the free CSV download provided by MaxMind (www.maxmind.com).
