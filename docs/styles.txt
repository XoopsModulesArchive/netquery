Netquery's configuration panel provides an administrator selection option that lists all
of its available CSS stylesheets and that selection also determines which set of query
type selector button images is used by Netquery.  (See explanation below.)

All Netquery download packages include two query type selector button image sets
(wlbuttons and blbuttons with white and black lettering respectively) and twelve CSS
stylesheets (one for each button set for each of the six Netquery standalone and CMS
environments).

Both of the supplied button sets are 40 pixels in width x 27 pixels in height and both
sets are transparent.  Their displayed background colors and/or images (several gradient
images supplied) are set in the CSS stylesheets (see special notes below) under the
following elements: input.inset, input.outset, input.gobutton, input.gobuttonup,
img.gobutton, img.gobuttonup

You can create and add your own stylesheets using the CSS files provided as examples.
Added CSS files must be located in the same folder as the others to be included in
Netquery's style options listing.

You can also create and add your own query selector button sets.  They must be located in
their own subfolder of the Netquery images folder and the (first part of the) file names
of any CSS stylesheets based on the new button set must correspond to the name of that
images subfolder.

The naming of CSS stylesheet files may use either an underscore (_) or a hyphen (-) to
separate the initial button set indicator part of the file name from the remainder.  For
example, selection of a stylesheet named redbuttons_newstyle.css will cause Netquery to
look for the buttons in an images subfolder named redbuttons.  A CSS file name containing
neither separator (e.g., mygreenstyle.css) will cause Netquery to use the entire file
base name (e.g., mygreenstyle) to look for a corresponding button images subfolder.

If the button images subfolder indicated by the name of a selected CSS stylesheet does not
exist, Netquery will revert to using a default button set.  Do NOT delete the button set
images that are supplied in the Netquery download package.

SPECIAL NOTE FOR PHP-FUSION USERS:

PHP-Fusion's current subheader makes no provision for particular CSS style requirments of
individual "plugins".  Netquery, therefore, to accomodate its admin selectable stylesheet
options, uses its own nqheader.php file instead.  The only difference is that Netquery's
nqheader.php file adds two lines to the PHP-Fusion (v6.00.305) subheader as follows:
<link rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' href='".INFUSIONS."netquery/styles/".$stylesheet."'>
<script type='text/javascript' src='".INFUSIONS."netquery/include/popup.js'></script>

--------
SPECIAL NOTE FOR XOOPS USERS:

Xoops requires an admin module update to recognize and list any added stylesheets in the
module's configuration options.

Netquery's interface design relies heavily on the selection of CSS stylesheets.  Xoops themes
that provide the <{$xoops_module_header}> feature make this possible only for Netquery's user
interface.  Xoops makes no similar provision for any module's admin interface or blocks.  To
partially compensate, the two CSS stylesheets that are provided for Xoops have been "translated"
as PHP include files to set in-line style values for use by Netquery's Xoops edition admin and
block coding.

Older Xoops themes that lack the <{$xoops_module_header}> feature entirely will not impair any
funtionality, but will prevent the CSS stylesheets selection feature of Netquery's Xoops edition
from properly setting up tables, images and other style elements of the module's user interface,
the appearance of which will thus be significantly degraded.

SPECIAL NOTE FOR XARAYA USERS:

As supplied, the blbuttons-xaraya.css stylesheet (the default for the Xaraya CMS) has most of
its background-color/image values commented out.  This anticipates that many users of Xaraya's
Classic theme (or adaptations thereof) will prefer to allow its very comprehensive background
switching to apply to the Netquery module's interface as well.  If not, you can select Netquery's
wlbuttons-xaraya CSS stylesheet which sets its own static backgrounds.  If you do want to apply
the Xaraya background color and image switching to Netquery's button set backgrounds also, just
append a few lines to the Xaraya theme's CSS files as follows:

Add to the style.css file --

input.outset, input.inset, input.gobutton, input.gobuttonup, img.gobutton, img.gobuttonup {
    color: #333333;
    border-color: #666699;
    background-color: #666699;
    background-image: url(../images/gradients.png);
    background-position: 0px -430px;
    background-repeat: repeat-x;
}

Add to the colorstyle_green.css file --

input.outset, input.inset, input.gobutton, input.gobuttonup, img.gobutton, img.gobuttonup {
    color: #003F3F;
    border-color: #669966;
    background-color: #669966;
    background-image: url(../images/green/gradients.png);
    background-position: 0px -430px;
    background-repeat: repeat-x;
}

Add to the colorstyle_orange.css file --

input.outset, input.inset, input.gobutton, input.gobuttonup, img.gobutton, img.gobuttonup {
    color: #7F5300;
    border-color: #996600;
    background-color: #996600;
    background-image: url(../images/orange/gradients.png);
    background-position: 0px -430px;
    background-repeat: repeat-x;
}

Add to the colorstyle_highcontrast.css file --

input.outset, input.inset, input.gobutton, input.gobuttonup, img.gobutton, img.gobuttonup {
    color: #000000;
    border-color: #666666;
    background-color: #666666;
    background-image: url(../images/highcontrast/gradients.png);
    background-position: 0px -430px;
    background-repeat: repeat-x;
}

HINT: You may choose to separate input.outset from the others and set a background-position
on the gradient image to modify the appearance of the unselected buttons.  Something around
0px -475px seems to work quite well.
